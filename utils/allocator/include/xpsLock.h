/* Description of xpLock semantics
 *
 * xpLock implements read/write locks. Although posix read/write locks are
 * used, it can change provided the API remain unaltered
 *
 * Recursive locking is implemented because of code requirements of XDK
 * Different situations are described below
 *
 * 1. Read lock is taken, read lock is called again by the same thread
 * Expected behavior:
 *      function _should_ return success
 * Rationale:
 *      Read lock is already held by self. One more read lock should not block
 * Constraint:
 *      Number of times read lock is called must match the number of times
 *      read unlock function is called to get the lock back to unlocked state
 *
 * 2. Read lock is taken, write lock is called by the same thread
 * Expected behavior:
 *      Write lock SHOULD NOT return success. Must fail and notify the
 *      programmer to correct the code flow by taking a write lock instead of
 *      read lock.
 * Rationale:
 *      There can be at least one other thread executing the same sequence --
 *      trying to obtain a write lock with corresponding read lock held.
 *      One of the threads (that does NOT get the lock will have to go back
 *      and re-read the value because the thread that got the lock have modified
 *      the value, making the previous value read inaccurate.
 *
 *      In the XDK, this will lead to code changes. So, the implemented behavior
 *      will let the programmer to correct the code.
 *
 * 3. Write lock taken, read lock is called
 * Expected behavior:
 *      Write lock is held means there are no readers. The same thread can
 *      take the read lock without any problem. Thus code path must return
 *      success
 *
 * 4. Write lock taken, write lock is called
 * Expected behavior:
 *      Same as (3). Thus code path must return success
