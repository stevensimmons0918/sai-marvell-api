/**
* @internal cpssEventIsrBind function
* @endinternal
*
* @brief   This routine binds a user process to unified event. The routine returns
*         a handle that is used when the application wants to check if there are
*         waiting events (cpssEventWaitingEventsGet), clear the already served
*         events (cpssEventTreatedEventsClear) , receive the event(cpssEventRecv)
*         This is alternative way of treating events as opposed of the other
*         Select mechanism used with function cpssEventBind(...) (where
*         Application had to wait on binary semaphore, which was released by the
*         relevant interrupt).
*         In the new scheme, the application provides an ISR function which would
*         be called whenever the relevant interrupt(s) have been occurred.
*         Thus, allowing the application to use any synchronism mechanism which
*         suits its needs.
*         The application ISR function would be called at Interrupt context !!!
*         NOTE : 1. the function does not mask/unmask the HW events in any device.
*         This is Application responsibility to unmask the relevant events
*         on the needed devices , using function cpssEventDeviceMaskSet or
*         cpssEventDeviceMaskWithEvExtDataSet
*         2. for this handler the function cpssEventSelect(..) is not
*         applicable.
