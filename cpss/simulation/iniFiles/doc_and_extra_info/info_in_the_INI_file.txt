in this file we state all the parameters that can be in the INI file that the simulations uses.
this file only state the different options that currently used by the simulation.
not all options relevant to all types of devices and/or systems.

==========================

about INI file:
1. Text file with parameters that describe the board.
2. The text file separated to sections by [section_name]
3. Comments are done using ‘;’
4. The NIC is treated as ‘device’.
5. all section and parameters are optional unless stated : MANDATORY parameter


supported sections and the parameters in the INI file:

----Section [system]----
1. devices_number - number of devices on board
  for example: devices_number = 8

For each device:
2. device_type0 - the device type (simulation string) - MANDATORY parameter
  for example: device_type7 = 98dx133
3. registers0 - relative/full path to file with 'reset values' for the device (AKA registers file)
  for example: registers7 = Registers_Cheetah_dx133_val.txt
  for example: registers7 = X:\pss\SW\prestera\simulation\registerFiles\Cheetah\Registers_Cheetah_dx133_val.txt
NOTE: can add several line of registers files for a device , so all be called sequentially
  3.a registers0_01 - file number 2
      registers0_02 - file number 3
      ...
      registers0_99 - file number 100 (max)


4. dev0_int_line - interrupt line of the device
  for example: dev7_int_line = 4
5. dev0_hw_id - the ‘hw id’ (bus address: pci/pex/smi/twsi) of the device
  for example : dev7_hw_id = 69999
6. dev0_to_slan_fcs_bytes_add - Add FCS 4 bytes recieve/send packets SLAN
  for example: dev7_to_slan_fcs_bytes_add = 1
7. dev0_to_cpu_fcs_bytes_add - Add FCS 4 bytes for send to CPU packets
  for example: dev7_to_cpu_fcs_bytes_add = 1
8. dev0_calc_fcs_enable - Enable FCS calculation for ethernet packets
  for example: dev7_calc_fcs_enable = 1
9. access_mode - SMI access mode -- for soho devices - Default is single-chip addressing mode
       values : 0 - single  , 1 - multi
  for example: access_mode = 1
10. dev0_nsram - narrow SRAM size , default is : 8MB.
  the value can be with 'M' or 'm' to indicate mega
  for example: dev7_nsram = 40M
11. dev0_nsram_mode - narow sram type , default is 'all externals'
   values are: 0 - ONE FOUR INTERNAL , 1 - ALL EXTERNAL , 2 - ONE TWO INTERNAL , 3 - THREE FOUR INTERNAL , 6 - ALL INTERNAL
  for example : dev1_nsram_mode = 2
12. dev0_wsram - wide SRAM size , default is : 128KB.
  the value can be with 'M' or 'm' to indicate mega
  for example: dev7_wsram = 4M
13. dev0_fdram - flow dram size , default size is 0
  the value can be with 'M' or 'm' to indicate mega
  for example: dev7_fdram = 16M
14. dev0_mem_dump - backup/restore memory file name , default is file : asic_memory_dump.txt
  needed for HSU (supported for EXMX only)
  for example:
   dev0_mem_dump = u:\twist_memory_dump.txt
15. dev0_use_pex_to_cpu - indication that the device is connected to the CPU via PEX (or not)
  (default is 'connected'     for device that     supports the PEX)
  (default is 'not connected' for device that NOT supports the PEX)
  for example:
   dev0_use_pex_to_cpu = 0
16. dev0_use_smi_to_cpu - indication that the device is connected to the CPU via SMI (or not)
  (default is 'not connected' for device that     supports the PEX)
  (default is 'connected'     for device that NOT supports the PEX)
  important : a device may not be connected 'directly' to the CPU , but via other device (using SMI)
  for example:
   dev0_use_smi_to_cpu = 1

17. dev0_use_smi_to_cpu_indirect - indication that the device is connected to the indirectly to the CPU via SMI (or not)
  (default is 'not connected' indirectly)
  important : a device may not be connected 'directly' to the CPU , but via other device (using SMI)
  for example:
   dev0_use_smi_to_cpu_indirect = 1
   
   
   
----Section [ports_map]----
ports on the board --> that need to support traffic. (SLANs)
NOTE : must match the SLAN names of the “other side” --> I.E of smb sim / RTG / Repeater.
Also used as cascade ports (Dx , Puma)
Also used as FA to FA connection. (ExMx)

1. dev0_port0 - the name of the media (slan) connected to the dev,port
  for example:
   dev0_port0  = slan00

   dev0_port8  = slan01

   dev0_port18 = slan02

   dev0_port23 = slan03


option to use seperate slan for RX then the one for the TX.
2. dev0_port0rx - slan for rx only for this dev,port
  for example: dev0_port0rx  = slan55rx


3. dev0_port0tx - slan for tx only for this dev,port
  for example: dev0_port0tx  = slan55tx



----Section [uplink]----
FA to PP (ExMx) connections

1. dev7=dev8 - upplink connection between devices.
   the devices on the 2 sides represent that they are connected to each other via uplink
   can be used for PP<-->PP or PP<-->FA or FA<-->PP
for example:
   dev2=dev0

   dev3=dev1


----Section [board_sections]----
each section run as different process
a device need to be in a board section (default is section 0)
1. dev_0_board_section - the board section the device belongs to.
  for example: 2 devices on board that belongs to 2 different sections 0,1
    dev_0_board_section=0
    dev_1_board_section=1
2. board_section - the board section.
     NOTE : this parameter should be in the 'command line' that runs the proccess.
            but it can be given in the INI file for cases that the INI files are splited for each process (although the split can be avoided)


----Section [fatal_error_file]----
1. file_name - The file to write to it the fatal error that occurred , default is : c:\\temp\\scor_fatal_error_file.txt
  for example : file_name = samba_fatal_error.txt


---section [debug]----
debug utilities
1. policer_conformance_level - set the conformance level of all the frames that ingress to the policer (traffic condition)
   this allow to check 'out of profile' decisions.
   by default the value of this parameter is 'green' (0)
   example : policer_conformance_level = 2
     --> this force to mark traffic as "RED"


----Section [rs]----
Section for general info , such as name of system/board.
1. name - The name (string) will appear as the ‘console title’ (win32)
   for example : name = DB-98EX240, initSystem 25,1,0,0


----Section [gm]----
Info for GM device - 0
1. print_error_stdout - print error strings to the 'stdout'
 For example : print_error_stdout = 1
2. print_log - print info into log file
  For example : print_log = 1
3. work_dir - path to working directory , where to create log file
 For example : work_dir = C:\\TEMP\\dtemp\\gm_dump_dev0\\
4. external_tcam_enable - does the device attached to IDT external tcam -- relevant to IDT only
   ip of station where nsa_model or other external_tcam simulation running
   NOTE: if external_tcam_enable = 0 then server_ip is not referenced
  For example : external_tcam_enable = 0
5. server_ip - IDT ip address of server (IDT process that simulate the tcam)
  default is: 127.0.0.1
  For example : server_ip = 10.6.150.22
6. en_fabric - run with BFM simulator
  For example : en_fabric = 0
7. external_tcam_type - external tcam type : 0 - IDT, 1 - NetLogic.
  For example : external_tcam_type = 1
8. external_tcam_speed - external tcam speed :0 - low speed, 1 - high speed.
  For example : external_tcam_speed =0
9. init_tbls - whether to perform hot initialization which load


---section [gm_1]----
Info for GM device - 1
same prameters as in [GM]

...

---section [gm_n]----
Info for GM device - n


----Section [Visualizer]----
Can enable/disable the visualizer (by default disabled)
1. enable - enable the visualizer
2. disable - disable the visualizer


----Section [distribution]----
1. file_name - Hold path to extra file that holds information for distributed system. (tpc-ip ports, addresses..)
  for example : file_name = X:\simulation\chip_simulation\simulation\iniFiles\distributed_simulation.txt
