The key for IPv6 packets is selected as follows:
0 = IP packets use the 48 bytes L2+IPv6 key.
1 = IP packets use the 48 bytes L4+IPv6 key.

lookUpEn - Enables Policy TCAM Lookup
0 = Search 0 is disabled.

    (Table 337: Policy Action Entry<n> (0<=n<1024) -- page 469)

    purpose: info about the action to apply on frame

matchCounterIndex - Valid if <Match CounterEn> is set to 1.
A pointer to one of the 32 policy rules match counters,
Policy Rule Match Counter<n> (0<=n<32).
The counter is incremented for every packet satisfying both of the following
conditions:
. Matching this rule.
. The previous packet command is not hard drop.

matchCounterEn - Enables the binding of this policy action entry to the Policy Rule Match
Counter<n> (0<=n<32) indexed by <Match CounterIndex>
0 = Match counter binding is disabled.
1 = Match counter binding is enabled.

pceModifyUp - Enables the modification of the packet.s 802.1p User Priority field.
Only relevant if QoS precedence of the previous QoS assignment mechanisms
(Port, Protocol Based QoS, and previous matching rule) is soft.
Applies to packets that are transmitted as VLAN tagged or transmitted via
Cascading ports with a Marvell tag in a FORWARD format.
When this field is set to 1 and the subsequent QoS assignment engines
have not changed this setting to enable the packet.s 802.1p User Priority
modification, the packet.s 802.1p User Priority field is set to UP extracted
from the QosProfile to QoS Table, when the packet is transmitted. This is
regardless of the incoming packet tag format (tagged or untagged).
0 = Keep previous ModifyUP setting.
1 = Set modify UP to 1.
2 = Set modify UP to 0.
3 = Reserved.

pceModifyDscp - Enables the modification of the packet.s DSCP field.
Only relevant if QoS precedence of the previous QoS assignment mechanisms
(Port, Protocol Based QoS, and previous matching rule) is soft.
Relevant for IPv4/IPv6 packets, only.
When this field is set to 1 and the subsequent QoS assignment engines
have not changed this setting to enable the packet.s DSCP modification,
the packet.s DSCP field is modified, when the packet is transmitted to the
DSCP extracted from the QosProfile to QoS Table.
0 = Keep previous DSCP modification command.
1 = Enable modification of the DSCP field in the packet.
2 = Disable modification of the DSCP field in the packet.
3 = Reserved.

pceQosProfile - Only relevant if the QoS precedence of the previous QoS Assignment
Mechanisms (Port, Protocol Based QoS, and previous matching rule) is soft
and <PCEQoS Profile MarkingEn> is set to 1.
If this is the QoSProfile that is assigned to the packet at the end of the
ingress pipe, <PCEQoSProfile> is used to index the QosProfile to QoS
Table and extract the QoS Parameters for the packet, which are TC, DP, UP
and DSCP

pceQosProfileMarkingEn
Relevant only if QoS precedence of the previous QoS Assignment Mechanisms
(Port, Protocol Based QoS, and previous matching rule) is soft.
0 = Preserve previous QoSProfile setting.
1 = Assign <PCEQoSProfile> to the packet.

pceQosPrecedence - (one of SKERNEL_QOS_PROF_PRECED_ENT)
PCE Marking of the QoSProfile Precedence.
Only relevant only if QoS precedence of the previous QoS Assignment
Mechanisms (Port, Protocol Based QoS, and previous matching rule) is
soft.
Setting this bit to 1, locks the QoS parameters setting from being modified
by subsequent QoS assignment engines in the ingress pipe.
0 = QoS precedence is soft and the packet.s QoS parameters may be over-
ride by subsequent QoS assignment engines
1 = QoS precedence is hard and the packet.s QoS parameters setting done
until this stage is locked. It cannot be overridden by subsequent QoS
assignment engines.
NOTE: The QoS precedence is not relevant in the policing engine. Non-
conforming traffic is re-marked according to the policing engine set-
ting regardless of their QoS precedence.

mirrorToIngressAnalyzerPort -
Enables the mirroring of the packet to the ingress analyzer port.
0 = Packet is not mirrored to ingress analyzer port.
1 = Packet is mirrored to ingress analyzer port configured in Analyzer Port
Configuration Register

pceCpuCode - Only relevant if <FwdCmd> is Mirror-to-CPU or Trap.
If at the end of the ingress pipe, this entry <FwdCmd> is assigned to the
packet. The packet that is forwarded to the CPU contains <PCE_
CPU_CODE> in its TO_CPU Marvell tag.

fwdCmd -  (one of SKERNEL_EXT_PACKET_CMD_ENT)
The entry forwarding command.
0 = Forward
1 = Mirror-to-CPU.
2 = Trap
3 = Hard Drop
4 = Soft Drop
5-7 = Reserved

pceVid - Only relevant if the VID precedence, set by the previous VID assignment
mechanisms (Port, Protocol Based VLANs, and previous matching rule), is
soft and <PCE VLANCmd>= 0.
The VLAN-ID set by this entry

pceVlanCmd - Relevant only if VID precedence set by the previous VID assignment
mechanisms (Port, Protocol Based VLANs, and previous matching rule) is soft.
0 = Don.t modify the VID assigned to the packet so far.
1 = <PCE_VID> is assigned to untagged packets or priority tagged packets.
2 = <PCE_VID> is assigned to tagged packets.
3 = <PCE_VID> is assigned to all packets.

enNestedVlan - When this field is set to 1, this rule matching flow is defined
as an access flow. The VID of all packets received on this flow is discarded and
they are assigned with a VID using the device.s VID assignment algorithms, as if
they are untagged.
When a packet received on an access flow is transmitted via a core port or
a Cascading port, a VLAN tag is added to the packet (on top of the existing
VLAN tag, if any). The VID field is the VID assigned to the packet as a result
of all VLAN assignment algorithms.
The 801.2p User Priority field of this added tag may be one of the following,
depending on the ModifyUP QoS parameter set to the packet at the end of
the Ingress pipe:
. If ModifyUP is 1, it is the UP extracted from the QosProfile to QoS
Table.
. If ModifyUP is 0, it is the original packet 802.1p User Priority field if it is
tagged and is <PUP> if the original packet is untagged.

pceVidPrecedence - The VLAN Assignment precedence for the subsequent VLAN assignment
mechanism, which is the policy engine next rule.
Only relevant if the VID precedence set by the previous VID assignment
mechanisms (Port, Protocol Based VLANs, and previous matching rule) is
soft.
0 = Soft precedence: The VID assignment can be overridden by the subsequent
VLAN assignment mechanism, which is the policy engine.
1 = Hard precedence: The VID assignment is locked to the last VLAN
assigned to the packet and cannot be overridden.

pceEgressInterface - see SNET_CHT_POLICY_EGRESS_INTERFACE_STC

pceRedirectCmd - This field enables the redirection of the matching flow packets
to an egress interface (a port, trunk, or a multicast group).
0 = Do not redirect.
1 = Redirect the packet to the Egress interface specified in
<PCE Egress Interface>.
<PCE Egress Interface>.2-3 = Reserved.
NOTE: Policy flow redirection bypasses the bridge engine.

policerIndex - Only valid if <PolicerEn> =1.

policerEn -
When set to 1, this rule is bonded to the policer indexed by <PolicerIndex>.
0 = Don.t use policer.
1 = Use policer.
