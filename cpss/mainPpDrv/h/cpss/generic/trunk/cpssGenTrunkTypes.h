*
* @brief API definitions for 802.3ad Link Aggregation (Trunk) facility
*
*
* States and Modes :
* A. Application can work in one of 2 modes:
* 1. use "high level" trunk manipulations set of APIs - Mode "HL"
* 2. use "low level" trunk HW tables/registers set of APIs - MODE "LL"
*
* B. Using "high level" trunk manipulations set of APIs - "High level"
* Mode.
* In this mode the CPSS synchronize all the relevant trunk
* tables/registers, implement some WA for trunks Errata.
* 1. Create trunk
* 2. Destroy trunk
* 3. Add/remove member to/from trunk
* 4. Enable/disable in trunk
* 5. Add/Remove port to/from "non-trunk" entry
* C. Using "low level" trunk HW tables/registers set of APIs- "Low level"
* Mode.
* In this mode the CPSS allow direct access to trunk tables/registers.
* In this mode the Application required to implement the
* synchronization between the trunk t6ables/registers and to implement
* the WA to some of the trunk Errata.
*
* 1. Set per port the trunkId
* 2. Set per trunk the trunk members , number of members
* 3. Set per trunk the Non-trunk local ports bitmap
* 4. Set per Index the designated local ports bitmap
*
* D. Application responsibility is not to use a mix of using API from
* those 2 modes
* The only time that the Application can shift between the 2 modes,
* is only when there are no trunks in the device.
*
*
* @version   7
