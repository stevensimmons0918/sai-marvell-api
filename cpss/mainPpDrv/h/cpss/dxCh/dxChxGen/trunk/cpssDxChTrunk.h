* @brief API definitions for 802.3ad Link Aggregation (Trunk) facility
* CPSS - DxCh
*
* "max number of trunks" - see description in cpssDxChTrunkInit(...)
*
* States and Modes :
* A. Application can work in one of 2 modes:
* 1. use "high level" trunk manipulations set of APIs - Mode "HL"
* 2. use "low level" trunk HW tables/registers set of APIs - MODE "LL"
*
* B. Using "high level" trunk manipulations set of APIs - "High level"
* Mode.
* In this mode the CPSS synchronize all the relevant trunk
* tables/registers, implement some WA for trunks Errata.
* 1. Set trunk members (enabled,disabled)
* 2. Add/remove member to/from trunk
* 3. Enable/disable member in trunk
* 4. Add/Remove port to/from "non-trunk" entry
* 5. set/unset designated member for Multi-destination traffic and
* traffic sent to Cascade Trunks
* 6. Set cascade trunk local ports
* 7. Trunk ECMP LTT table (on applicable devices)
* C. Using "low level" trunk HW tables/registers set of APIs- "Low level"
* Mode.
* In this mode the CPSS allows direct access to trunk tables/registers.
* In this mode the Application required to implement the
* synchronization between the trunk tables/registers and to implement
* the WA to some of the trunk Errata.
*
* 1. Set per port the trunkId
* 2. Set per trunk the trunk members , number of members
* 3. Set per trunk the Non-trunk local ports bitmap
* 4. Set per Index the designated local ports bitmap
* 5. Set per trunk the Trunk ECMP LTT entry (on applicable devices)
*
* D. Application responsibility is not to use a mix of using API from
* those 2 modes
* The only time that the Application can shift between the 2 modes,
* is only when there are no trunks in the device.
*
* @version   32

     *  a. cpssDxChBrgL2EcmpTableSet(...) :
     *  The CPSS will allows application full access to all 'L2 ECMP' table entries
     *  (in mode of CPSS_DXCH_TRUNK_MEMBERS_MODE_NATIVE_E :

     *  to the 'ePort ECMP lookup translation' table
     *  (in mode of CPSS_DXCH_TRUNK_MEMBERS_MODE_NATIVE_E :
     *  the application is limited to point to the lower half of the 'L2 ECMP' table)
     *  NOTE: for both APIs the CPSS will not check for 'collisions' with 'trunk settings'
     *  3. Choosing this mode also impact 'designated member table' :
     *  As this table is limited to 64 members (64 for UC , and separate 64 for MC),
     *  only the first 64 members of the 'flex' trunk will be represented
     *  in the 'designated member table'.
     *  So only those first 64 ports can 'flood' in vlan (single one per 'flood').
     *  Expectations from Application:
     *  1. Not to 'modify' entries in 'L2 ECMP' table those were 'given' to the
     *  CPSS for trunk management.
     *  2. Not to point from 'ePort ECMP lookup translation' to 'L2 ECMP'

*         - trunk members table is empty (see cpssDxChTrunkTableEntrySet)
*         Therefore it cannot be used as target by ingress engines like FDB,
*         Router, TTI, Ingress PCL and so on.
*         - members ports trunk ID are set (see cpssDxChTrunkPortTrunkIdSet).
*         Therefore packets ingresses in member ports are associated with trunk
*         - all members are enabled only and cannot be disabled.
*         - may be used for cascade traffic and pointed by the 'Device map table'
*         as the local target to reach to the 'Remote device'.

* @internal cpssDxChTrunkDbSharedPortInfoSet function

*
* @brief   Function Relevant mode : High level mode
*          The function hold info about 'per trunk' behavior in 'shared port'
*          that a trunk member can be shared between several trunks.
*          This is part of the feature "Single Port – Multiple Trunks"
*          NOTEs:
*          1. Application should call this function before creating the trunk (cascade/regular)
*           (initialization time)
*          2. The function stores the info to the CPSS DB (no HW operations)
*          3. The 'default' behavior (if this function not called for a trunk)
*             is 'manipulate the shared ports' (to be compatible with legacy behavior)
*
* @note   APPLICABLE DEVICES:      xCat3; AC5; Lion2; Bobcat2; Caelum; Aldrin; AC3X; Bobcat3; Aldrin2; Falcon; AC5P; AC5X; Harrier; Ironman.
* @note   NOT APPLICABLE DEVICES:  None.
*
* @param[in] devNum                - the device number.
* @param[in] trunkId               - trunk Id
* @param[in] sharedPortInfoPtr     - (pointer to) the trunk info about the shared ports.
*
* @retval GT_OK                    - on success
