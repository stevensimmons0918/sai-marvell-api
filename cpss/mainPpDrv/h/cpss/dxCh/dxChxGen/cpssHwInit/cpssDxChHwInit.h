     *  Comments:
     *  1.  The Driver allocates Tx descriptors, Rx Descriptors, and Rx data
     *  buffers out of the respective blocks of memory provided by the user.
     *  The number of allocated items is a function of the block size, item
     *  structure size, and the HW alignment requirement for the specific
     *  item (and the Rx Buffer headerOffset as defined in sysConfig.h)
     *  2.  The Prestera PP PCI Host Interface directly updates the Rx/Tx
     *  descriptors, Rx data buffers, and the Address Update Queue.
     *  It is the user's responsibility to determine whether these memory
     *  blocks (txDescBlock, rxDescBlock, rxbufBlock, AUQ) are from
     *  cachable. non-cachable memory regions. For example if the
     *  system supports cache-coherency between the CPU & the
     *  PCI, those blocks can be in a cacheble area with no
     *  special handling
     *  If there is no cache coherency, then:
     *  1) the Rx/Tx descriptors must be allocated from non-cachable
     *  memory.
     *  2) the Rx data buffers and AUQ may be from cachable memory,
     *  if the user flushes the buffer memory cache prior to
     *  returning the buffer to the Rx pool, and cache-line
     *  reads do not cross data buffer boundaries.
     *  3.  The provided auDescBlock will be divided into AU descriptors. The
     *  size of each AU descriptor can be obtained via
     *  cpssDxChHwAuDescSizeGet(), The number of address update descriptors
     *  is calculated by:(auDescBlockSize / <size of a single descriptor> ).
     *  4.  The number of Rx descriptors to be allocated per Rx queue will be
     *  calculated as follows:
     *  -  if <allocation method> = STATIC_ALLOC, then the number of
     *  Rx descs. per Rx queue will be:
     *  (rxBufBlockSize / rxBufSize) / <number of Rx queues>
     *  while The Rx buffer size must be a multiple of 8.
     *  In this case the user must take care to provide an Rx Desc.
     *  block which is large enough to allocate an Rx desc. per
     *  allocated Rx buffer.
     *  -  if <allocation method> = DYNAMIC_ALLOC, then the number of
     *  Rx descriptors per queue will be:
     *  (rxDescBlockSize / <size of a single Rx desc.>) /
     *  <number of Rx queues>.
     *  The size of a single Rx descriptor can be obtained by
     *  calling cpssDxChHwRxDescSizeGet().
     *  rxBufSize in the above calculations is received via TAPI
     *  sysConfig.h sysConfig() API.
