// Short Description: entropy label:
// Description:       configure MPLS transit

//Test description:
//
//configure a trunk index 10 with 2 ports in it: port[2] and port[3]
//Ingress: Two MPLS packets with entropy label. the only difference between the packets is that they have
//         different entropy labels
//Action: The packet will have a match in the TTI table according to the MPLS labels configured in the command.
//        it will not NOT be TT but redirected to the trunk, the packet will get properties from TS.
//        my-mac-addr 00:01:02:03:34:02 is used to configure macToMe entry.
//Egress: one packet will egress to port[2] and the other will egress to port[3] according to load balancing
//        done due to different entropy labels.
//        egress-mac-sa-addr 00:04:05:06:07:12 is the mac SA in the egress packet
//        (if the mpls-command is SWAP, PUSH1, POP_AND_SWAP then the SA is taken form the TS,
//        otherwise it is taken from the ARP table), nexthop-mac-da-addr 00:01:02:03:34:03 is the mac DA of the egress packet
