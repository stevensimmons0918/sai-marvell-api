 * WRED APIs

/**
 * \brief Configure WRED on an AQM Q Profile
 *
 * Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED for short) is an Active
 * Queue Management Scheme that is used to smoothen out
 * congestion due to a bursty flow over a period of time
 *
 * This smoothening happens by virtue of detecting congestion
 * "early" in other words once a queue starts to build, the
 * Queuing system will start to randomly drop or mark packets at
 * a well known rate. This rate grows linerarly with the average
 * queue length
 *
 * What this means is that as your queue builds up over time,
 * your likelihood of dropping or marking  a packet increases up
 * until you cross a max threshold. Once you cross this max
 * threshold, you will always either drop or mark your packets
 * with ECN
 *
 * Weighted RED is different from regular RED in that a weight
 * can be applied on the calculation of the average queue length
 * at the time of AQM. The calculation of the average queue
 * length generally follows this formula:
 *
 *      * avg q len = o * (1 - 2^-weight) + c * (2^-weight)
 *
 * Where o is the old queue length and c is the current q
 * length. If your weight is a large number you will bias the
 * new average q length calculation in favor of the old length
 * and vice versa
 *
 * Weighted RED allows the user a great amount of control over
 * this graph:

 * \brief Configure Queue tail drop max threshold in pages.
 *
 * Tail drop is the fundamental method of resource allocation
 * used in switches today. It relies on instantaneous feedback
 * of queue utilization to dictate whether or not a packet
 * should be enqueued
 *
 * For example, if a tail drop threshold is set to 120 pages,
 * and the queue at time T currently has 115 pages enqueued. At
 * time T+1 a packet of size 6 pages comes in and requests
 * whether or not it can be enqueued, the Tail Drop threshold

 * it by enqueued
 *
 * Unlike WRED which uses historical data of queuing, Tail Drop
 * uses only instantaneous information
 *
 * This Tail Drop threshold is in pages, which is a byte
 * resolution, there is another tail drop threshold in packets.
 * Both can exist at the same time and either one can decide to

 * \brief Get a configured Alpha Value for a Dynamic Lossy Pool
 *
 * A Dynamic Pool allows for multiple queues to both increase
 * their total Burst Capacity by virtue of borrowing pages from
 * other Queues, and maintain fairness in Packet Memory
 * utilization
 *
 * In the case where a Shared Pool is simply statically
 * thresholded, a single Queue can use up the entire shared pool
 * in a large burst scenario, which leads to Head-Of-Line
 * blocking for all other Queues that can use this Shared Packet
 * Memory resource
 *
 * The ideal Shared Packet Memory accounting algorithm would
 * allow for a single Queue to increase its dynamic burst
 * capcity when congested and also maintain enough Packet Memory
 * to not starve other potential queues from utilizing buffers
 *
 * This can be achieved using a Dynamic Thresholding algorithm
 * that derives the Queue Tail Drop threshold based off the
 * current overall pool buffer utilization
 *
 * This formula requies an "alpha" coefficient to be set in
 * order to set the agressiveness of the queue utilization of
 * the dynamic pool
 *
 * The Queue Dynamic Tail Drop formula is as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * q_dyn_td_thld = alpha(DP_size - DP_used)
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * During AQM, a Lossy queue will decide to drop a packet due to
 * current Queue Buffer utilization if the following equation is
 * satsified
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * (q_cur_len + new_pkt_len > max(q_dyn_td_thld, q_guar_td_thld)) ? drop pkt : fwd pkt
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * When the system reaches a steady state of congestion, we can
 * approximate each queue length as per the following formula
 *
 * <pre>
 *                     alpha
 * q_cur_len = max(------------ * DP_Size, q_guar_td_thld)
 *                 1 + (alpha)N
 *
 * Where N is the number of Active Queues in the Dynamic Pool
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * In addition at steady state, the approximate available buffer
 * in the Dynamic Pool's shared section will follow this
 * formula:
 *
 * <pre>
 *                    1
 * dp_unused = (------------ * DP_Size)
 *              1 + (alpha)N
 *
 * Where N is the number of Active Queues in the Dynamic Pool
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following graph shows a picture of how the number of
 * congested queues actively using a dynamic pool will impact
 * the burst size of a single queue

 * When using a Dynamic Pool to increase burst tolerance for
 * lossless traffic by dynamically calculating XOFF thresholds,
 * some devices in the XPA family also support dynamically
 * deriving the XON threshold based on the currently calculated
 * XOFF threshold
 *
 * This feature usually requires configuring an XON to XOFF
 * ratio parameter which can be configured using:
 *
 * \see xpsQosFcConfigurePfcTcDynamicPoolXoffToXonRatio
 *
 * However, some devices in the XPA family support turning this
 * feature off and reverting back to a statically configured XON
 * threshold on a per node basis
 *
 * There are pros and cons to each approach:
 * - When disabled, traffic will be less bursty, but lossless
 *   latency may be greater
 * - When enabled, traffic will be bursty, but lossless latency
 *   may be lower

 * \brief This API will configure a desired Xoff to Xon Ratio

 *
 * Considering using a Dynamic Pool to allow for a fairer
 * utilization of a Shared Packet Memory section results in a
 * Dynamic Xoff Threshold, there needs to be some method of
 * configuring the Xon Threshold dynamically as well
 *
 * As stated in \ref fcpfc0, the Xoff Threshold and Xon window
 * form a window which is usually around 1 Round Trip Time of
 * propagation delay worth of Buffer, we can consider the Xon
 * Threshold a function of the RTT
 *
 * Since the Xoff threshold is usually also a function of RTT,
 * it can be stated that the Xon threshold is a function of the
 * Xoff threshold by the transitive property
 *
 * Knowing this, there is a way to configure the parameters of a
 * simple equation to calculate a Dynamic Xon Threshold based
 * off of the calculated Dynamic Xoff Threshold using the
 * "Alpha" parameter
 *
 * \see xpsQosFcConfigurePfcTcDynamicPoolAlpha
 *
 * The equation used to calculate the Xoff Threshold dynamically
 * in the XPA architecture takes three parameters:
 *      - Beta
 *      - Gamma
 *      - Operator
 *
 * These paramters are used as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 *  xon_dyn_thld = (beta +/- gamma) * xoff_dyn_thld
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * This provides a way of configuring what amounts to a dynamic
 * sliding window of hysteresis based off the current dyanmic
 * utilization of the Shared Lossless buffer amongst various PFC
 * Nodes
 *
 * This diagram illustrates the sliding window in effect based
 * off of the current overall utilization of the Lossless
 * Dynamic Pool
